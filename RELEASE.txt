Mondrian 3.4.0-GA production release notes
=============================================

Introduction
------------

Mondrian 3.4.0-GA is a major refactoring of Mondrian's internals
and the way it handles & stores the cell data. This release makes
Mondrian much more scalable and much more effective in the way it
uses the system threads.

This release also introduces a new algorithm to load, share and
rollup the data cells, or segments. Mondrian will rollup and union
the segment data from low levels, in memory, to answer queries
related to higher levels. This provides a huge improvement in
performance on systems with high user interactivity.

It is also worth noting that the Mondrian project now hosts its
source code on github. The official source code can now be found
at: github.com/pentaho/mondrian

To find out more about Mondrian, go to http://mondrian.pentaho.com.

 - Simplified and improved the SegmentCache SPI.
 - Introduces the Mondrian Monitor API.
 - Refactored some key parts of the engine into an
   implementation of the Actor design pattern, providing more
   effective resource sharing and the elimination of many
   synchronization blocks.
 - SQL queries for cell data is now fetched by a multi-threaded
   executor and the tasks are shared among the query threads.

   query.
 - Ability to combine data of an existing segment with data form SQL.

MONDRIAN-821 - Adds a unique ID property to the Schema API. This id

               caches when that ID changes. This usually happened
